URF Play Styles - Riot Games API Challenge entry
==============

by Wong Man Hang (NA: microtony, Taiwan: å¾®Tony)

This project aims to understand how players changed their play style in the URF game mode and the effects. k-means clustering was used to obtain 5 item build centroids (Marksman, Mage, Fighter, Support and Tank). After that, items builds from matches are categorized into one of the 5 centroids. Results are finally aggregated and presented in the mini AngularJS application.

Note: Marksman is not restricted to ranged champions.
